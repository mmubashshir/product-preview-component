## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to call the API using async/await function's and call the url using fetch API. I made a custom div i.e the dice icon as a clickable button, was not sure initially about its working. Anyways it was fun building it.

### Continued development

I would like to continue improving my HTML/CSS but mean time i would also like to build full stack websites involving Databases like MongoDB. Morever i would like to get familiar with react,redux and nextJS like frameworks.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Docs for fetch API](https://www.example.com) - All other methods were depracated, used the asynchronous way i.e using async.
- [Make div Clickable](https://www.delftstack.com/howto/javascript/make-a-div-clickable/) - Just simply shows how a div can be clickable.
